This is a journal of my experience building this project.

10/10/2023 21:00 ; Training-Validation Split Issue
After following the tensorflow tutorial and training the model using those parameters, I was
excited that the validation accuracy was nearly 99%. However, I was disappointed when I deployed
the model for further testing and the accuracy was very bad. I assumed the model had overfit my
training data but I couldn't understand why the validation accuracy was so high. I spent a few
days collectiong more data to use as a totally seperate validation dataset instead of using the
train-validation split method. After retraining on the initial dataset and testing it on the new
validation dataset, I started to get validation accuracy that matched what I was seeing in
"production." The data collection method leads to a lot of known data replication and, I theorize,
this causes cross-contaminates between the training and validation dataset when usingthe random data
splitting approach.

11/20/2023 13:46 ; Hydra Setup
It took a while to learn, set up and integrate hydra into the project. This is partly due to my day job
workload, family visiting, and my son being born. However, meaningful integration of hydra and learning how
to use it was not easy. The easy of which it allows one ot automate experimentation should be worth it though.
I have yet to set up hydra logging and experimental data analysis quite yet. DVC integrates with hydra so it
might be worth looking into the capabilities of this tool.
