10/10/2023 21:00 ; Training-Validation Split Issue
After following the tensorflow tutorial and training the model using those parameters, I was
excited that the validation accuracy was nearly 99%. However, I was disappointed when I deployed
the model for further testing and the accuracy was very bad. I assumed the model had overfit my
training data but I couldn't understand why the validation accuracy was so high. I spent a few
days collectiong more data to use as a totally seperate validation dataset instead of using the
train-validation split method. After retraining on the initial dataset and testing it on the new
validation dataset, I started to get validation accuracy that matched what I was seeing in
"production." The data collection method leads to a lot of known data replication and, I theorize,
this causes cross-contaminates between the training and validation dataset when usingthe random data
splitting approach.
